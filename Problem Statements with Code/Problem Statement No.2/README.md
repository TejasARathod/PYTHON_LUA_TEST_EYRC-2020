## Calculate the distance between 2 points

Given 2 points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where x1, x2 are x-coordinates and y1, y2 are y-coordinates of the points.

Oour task was to compute the Euclidean distance between them.

The code stub provided here is to be used. It calls the function compute_distance(). Your task is to complete the function.

The distance computed should be precise up to 2 decimal places.
## Input
- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains single line of four integers in sequence x1, y1, x2, y2 separated by space
## Output
For each testcase, print the Euclidean distance output as: "Distance: computed_distance_value"
## Constraints
- 1≤T≤25 
- 100≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤100
## Subtasks
- **Subtask #1 (30 points):** −20≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤20
- **Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints
## Sample Input
    2
    -1 0 5 0
    2 1 6 -2
## Sample Output
    Distance: 6.00
    Distance: 5.00
