## Ifs and Fors with Python

The task is to read an integer n from STDIN.

For all values of i<n in ascending order, do the following:

    If i is non-zero then,
    - print the square of i, if i is odd.
    - print double the value of i, if i is even.
    If i is zero then, add 3 to i.
## Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer n.
## Output
For each test case, print a single line containing n space-separated integers computed based on the given condition. Note: There should be no space after printing the last integer.
