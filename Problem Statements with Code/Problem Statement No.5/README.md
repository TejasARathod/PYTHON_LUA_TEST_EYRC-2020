## Decimal to Binary converter
Given a decimal number n, your task is to convert it to its binary equivalent using a recursive function.

The code stub provided here is to be used. It calls the function dec_to_binary(). Your task is to complete the function.

The binary number output must be of length 8 bits.
## Input
- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains single integer n
## Output
- For each testcase, print the binary equivalent with length of 8 bits
## Constraints
- 1≤T≤25
- 0≤n≤255
## Subtasks
- **Subtask #1 (30 points):** n≤20
- **Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints
## Sample Input
    2
    5
    32
## Sample Output
    00000101
    00100000
